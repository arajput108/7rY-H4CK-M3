One of the methods for geolocating an image is to do an image reverse search. This means that we are 
searching for the image itself online, and if the image has been indexed by search engines we may find 
the exact image or we can do a visual search or crop search to help us find similar images. 

 Aric Toler (https://x.com/AricToler) from Bellingcat has written a fantastic guide on reversing images, 
 please read it here (https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/12/26/guide-to-using-reverse-image-search-for-investigations/). 
 OSINT Curious (https://www.osintcurio.us/) also has a write-up (https://www.osintcurio.us/2020/04/12/tips-and-tricks-on-reverse-image-searches/) 
 on the topic that you should look through before attempting this challenge. 

I recommend adding this extension to ease the workflow for when you find images online that you want to do an image reverse on:

Addon description: "Perform a search by image. Choose between the image search engines Google, Bing, Yandex, TinEye and Baidu."

Chrome: RevEye Reverse Image Search ( https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/RevEye%20Reverse%20Image%20Search?hl=no)

Firefox: RevEye Reverse Image Search

Remember that changing the crop and the keywords for searching an image may yield completely different results.
