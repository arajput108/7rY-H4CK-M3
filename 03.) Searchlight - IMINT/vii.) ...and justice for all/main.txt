This challenge is a step up in difficulty from the previous challenges and you shouldn't expect to solve this quickly, 
especially if you are new to IMINT. While you can certainly apply the techniques and tools you've used to s far, this 
challenge may force you to revise your thinking and your approach while you're working on solving this challenge. 
I highly recommend watching this Ted talk by Amy Herman on visual intelligence - "A lesson on looking" 
if you want a unique view on how you perceive visual data.
