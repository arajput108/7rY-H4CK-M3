Q. What is bash?
A. Bash is a scripting language that runs within the terminal on most Linux distros, as well as MacOS. 
   Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file, combined together to achieve more complex 
   tasks than simple one-liner and are especially useful when it comes to automating sysadmin tasks such as backups.
