Variables allow you to store and update data in a computer program. You have a variable name 
and store data to that name.

Ex: food = "ice cream"
    money = 2000

In the example above, we have 2 variables. The variable name "food" stores the string (words) 
ice cream, while another variable called "money" stores a number (2000).

Variables are powerful as you can change them throughout your program. The following example sets 
the age variable to 30, then we increase this age variable by 1, making the final variable data 31. 
Feel free to copy and paste this into the editor, run the code, and see its output.

Ex: age = 30
    age = age + 1
    print(age)

Notice, on line 2, the way we update a variable, on the left, and we have the already created variable 
name "age" followed by the = operator. On the right, we have what we're setting the variable to; in our 
case, the age variable (which is currently set to 30) is being increased by 1.

Let's talk about Data Types, which is the type of data being stored in a variable. You can store text, 
or numbers, and many other types. The data types to know are:

* String - Used for combinations of characters, such as letters or symbols
* Integer - Whole numbers
* Float - Numbers that contain decimal points or for fractions
* Boolean - Used for data that is restricted to True or False options
* List - Series of different data types stored in a collection
