Let's now cover mathematical operators and how they can be applied to Python. Like a calculator, 
there are operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing; using Python, we can 
code our calculator; after all, programming is just writing rules for the computer to follow given 
specific inputs and conditions. The table below shows the different operations.

Operator                              Syntax                                 Example
Addition                                +                                   1 + 1 = 2
Subtraction                             -                                   5 - 1 = 4
Multiplication                          *                                   10 * 10 = 100
Division                                /                                   10 / 2 = 5
Modulus                                 %                                   10 % 2 = 0
Exponent                               **                                   5**2  = 25 (5^2)


Now that we know basic mathematical operators, let's move on to comparison operators; these play a 
big part in Python and will be built upon when we look at loops and if statements. These operators 
are used to evaluate a program's condition at a particular state.

Symbol                                                   Syntax
Greater than                                               >
Less than                                                  <
Equal to                                                   ==
Not Equal to                                               !=
Greater than or equal to                                   >=
Less than or equal                                         <=



1.) print the result of 21 + 43. What is the flag?
    a= 21
    b= 43
    c= a + b
    print(c)
    O/p= 64
    Flag: THM{ADDITI0N}

2.) Print the result of 142 - 52. What is the flag?
    a= 142
    b= 52
    c= a - b
    print(c)
    O/p= 90
    Flag: THM{SUBTRCT}

3.) Print the result of 10 * 342. What is the flag?
    a= 10
    b= 342
    c= a * b
    print(c)
    O/p= 3420
    Flag: THM{MULTIPLICATION_PYTHON}

4.) Print the result of 5 squared. What is the flag?
    a= 5
    b= 2
    c= a ** b
    print(c)
    O/p= : 25
    Flag: THM{EXP0N3NT_POWER}
