--> Let's make this a bit trickier...







<--------------------------Concepts--------------------------->
1.) Base16 (Hexadecimal):
    Only contains digits (0-9) and letters A-F (or a-f).
    Typically used in computing, especially for representing binary data or memory 
    addresses in human-readable form.

2.) Base32:
    Uses a 32-character set (A-Z, 2-7).
    Less common but used in specific applications like QR codes or file encoding.

3.) Base64:
    Ends with = or == padding.
    Characters include letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), +, /, and sometimes =.
    Useful for encoding binary data, often seen in web data transmission, email 
    attachments, and image encoding.

4.) Moorse Code

10.) This is a combination of Base64 -> Morse code -> Binary ->ROT47 -> Decimal.


Tool used:
1.) CyberChef 2.) Command-line tools 3.) Dcode.fr








<--------------------------Explanation--------------------------->
Q7.) In Hit & Trial, found at ROT47.

Q8.) This sequence appears to be Morse code. Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off 
   tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment.
   The deciphered message reads: "TELECOMMUNICATION ENCODING"
Explanation:-
Parse Morse code symbols into letters by recognizing dots and dashes.
Translate each symbol individually.Reassemble the words to get the message. This approach is systematic and can be repeated for other Morse-coded messages!

Q9.) *Your input (85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68) is decimal, not hexadecimal (base16). You need to 
    convert these decimal values into hexadecimal first:
    *Use xxd to decode the hexadecimal string: echo "556e7061636b207468697320424344" | xxd -r -p
 Explanation:
-r: Tells xxd to reverse the process (from hex to ASCII).
-p: Tells xxd to use plain hexadecimal input.
