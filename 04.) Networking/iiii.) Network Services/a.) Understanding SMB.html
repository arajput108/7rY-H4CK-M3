Q.) What is SMB?
A.) SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, 
    printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. 
    Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs) available to clients on the network. 
    Client computers may have their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers 
    on the servers.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the 
client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as 
specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.
